        "The main goal of RAG is to improve the generation outptus of LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two primary improvements can be seen as:\n",
        "1. **Preventing hallucinations** - LLMs are incredible but they are prone to potential hallucination, as in, generating something that *looks* correct but isn't. RAG pipelines can help LLMs generate more factual outputs by providing them with factual (retrieved) inputs. And even if the generated answer from a RAG pipeline doesn't seem correct, because of retrieval, you also have access to the sources where it came from.\n",
        "2. **Work with custom data** - Many base LLMs are trained with internet-scale text data. This means they have a great ability to model language, however, they often lack specific knowledge. RAG systems can provide LLMs with domain-specific data such as medical information or company documentation and thus customized their outputs to suit specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors of the original RAG paper mentioned above outlined these two points in their discussion.\n",

        "strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\n",
        "with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\n",
        "employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society, for example by endowing it\n",
        "with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\n",

        "For example you could use RAG for:\n",
        "* **Customer support Q&A chat** - By treating your existing customer support documentation as a resource, when a customer asks a question, you could have a system retrieve relevant documentation snippets and then have an LLM craft those snippets into an answer. Think of this as a \"chatbot for your documentation\". Klarna, a large financial company, [uses a system like this](https://www.klarna.com/international/press/klarna-ai-assistant-handles-two-thirds-of-customer-service-chats-in-its-first-month/) to save $40M per year on customer support costs.\n",
        "* **Email chain analysis** - Let's say you're an insurance company with long threads of emails between customers and insurance agents. Instead of searching through each individual email, you could retrieve relevant passages and have an LLM create strucutred outputs of insurance claims.\n",
        "* **Company internal documentation chat** - If you've worked at a large company, you know how hard it can be to get an answer sometimes. Why not let a RAG system index your company information and have an LLM answer questions you may have? The benefit of RAG is that you will have references to resources to learn more if the LLM answer doesn't suffice.\n",
        "* **Textbook Q&A** - Let's say you're studying for your exams and constantly flicking through a large textbook looking for answers to your quesitons. RAG can help provide answers as well as references to learn more.\n",

        "| Term | Description |\n",
        "| ----- | ----- |\n",
        "| **Token** | A sub-word piece of text. For example, \"hello, world!\" could be split into [\"hello\", \",\", \"world\", \"!\"]. A token can be a whole word,<br> part of a word or group of punctuation characters. 1 token ~= 4 characters in English, 100 tokens ~= 75 words.<br> Text gets broken into tokens before being passed to an LLM. |\n",
        "| **Embedding** | A learned numerical representation of a piece of data. For example, a sentence of text could be represented by a vector with<br> 768 values. Similar pieces of text (in meaning) will ideally have similar values. |\n",
        "| **Embedding model** | A model designed to accept input data and output a numerical representation. For example, a text embedding model may take in 384 <br>tokens of text and turn it into a vector of size 768. An embedding model can and often is different to an LLM model. |\n",
        "| **Similarity search/vector search** | Similarity search/vector search aims to find two vectors which are close together in high-demensional space. For example, <br>two pieces of similar text passed through an embedding model should have a high similarity score, whereas two pieces of text about<br> different topics will have a lower similarity score. Common similarity score measures are dot product and cosine similarity. |\n",
        "| **Large Language Model (LLM)** | A model which has been trained to numerically represent the patterns in text. A generative LLM will continue a sequence when given a sequence. <br>For example, given a sequence of the text \"hello, world!\", a genertive LLM may produce \"we're going to build a RAG pipeline today!\".<br> This generation will be highly dependant on the training data and prompt. |\n",
        "| **LLM context window** | The number of tokens a LLM can accept as input. For example, as of March 2024, GPT-4 has a default context window of 32k tokens<br> (about 96 pages of text) but can go up to 128k if needed. A recent open-source LLM from Google, Gemma (March 2024) has a context<br> window of 8,192 tokens (about 24 pages of text). A higher context window means an LLM can accept more relevant information<br> to assist with a query. For example, in a RAG pipeline, if a model has a larger context window, it can accept more reference items<br> from the retrieval system to aid with its generation. |\n",
        "| **Prompt** | A common term for describing the input to a generative LLM. The idea of \"[prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)\" is to structure a text-based<br> (or potentially image-based as well) input to a generative LLM in a specific way so that the generated output is ideal. This technique is<br> possible because of a LLMs capacity for in-context learning, as in, it is able to use its representation of language to breakdown <br>the prompt and recognize what a suitable output may be (note: the output of LLMs is probable, so terms like \"may output\" are used). |\n",

        "\n",
        "We discussed RAG briefly in the beginning but let's quickly recap.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Which is another way of saying \"given a query, search for relevant resources and answer based on those resources\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's breakdown each step:\n",
        "* **Retrieval** - Get relevant resources given a query. For example, if the query is \"what are the macronutrients?\" the ideal results will contain information about protein, carbohydrates and fats (and possibly alcohol) rather than information about which tractors are the best for farming (though that is also cool information).\n",
        "* **Augmentation** - LLMs are capable of generating text given a prompt. However, this generated text is designed to *look* right. And it often has some correct information, however, they are prone to hallucination (generating a result that *looks* like legit text but is factually wrong). In augmentation, we pass relevant information into the prompt and get an LLM to use that relevant information as the basis of its generation.\n",
        "* **Generation** - This is where the LLM will generate a response that has been flavoured/augmented with the retrieved resources. In turn, this not only gives us a potentially more correct answer, it also gives us resources to investigate more (since we know which resources went into the prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "The whole idea of RAG is to get an LLM to be more factually correct based on your own input as well as have a reference to where the generated output may have come from.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an incredibly helpful tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say you had 1000s of customer support documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "You could use RAG to generate direct answers to questions with links to relevant documentation.\n",

        "\n",

        "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",

        "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
        "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
        "\\nExample 3:\n",
        "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
        "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",
